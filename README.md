# Group 12: Beijing PM2.5
This is the project repository for Group 12 in STAT547M in the University of British Columbia. The project is an assessment of PM2.5 pollution from 2010 to 2014 in Beijing, China.

## Introduction 
1. Project Interest    
Beijing, the capital city of China, has been fighting against `PM2.5` pollution in recent years. `PM2.5` are fine airborne particles less than 2.5μm that can cause severe damage to human health. Meteorological conditions(wind, humidity, etc) can contribute to the formation of `PM2.5` according to previous studies. We are interested in whether there are correlations between Beijing’s `PM2.5` concentration and  meteorological conditions. If so, analyzing meteorological conditions can help us assess and even predict the air quality in Beijing.    

2. Data Description   
The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00381/PRSA_data_2010.1.1-2014.12.31.csv) we used is from [University of California Irvine Machine learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data#). It was originally uploaded by Songxi Chen in Peking University, China. This is an hourly dataset containing `PM2.5` concentration and meteorological statistics from Jan 1st, 2010 to Dec 31st, 2014.   

3. Plans    
We attempt to address whether Beijing's `PM2.5` is correlated with meteorological conditions(dew point, temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction, rain or snow) and time(year, month, day). Our steps include: data cleaning, correlation tests, linear regression analyses, plotting, dashboard creation. A more detailed proposal in HTML version can be found [here](https://stat547-ubc-2019-20.github.io/group_12_qiyangqd_xiaoyuanf/docs/milestone1.html).

## Usage   

1. Clone this repo.    

2. Ensure the following packages are installed:       
  
   `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `tidyverse`, `docopt`, `here`, `glue`, `ggplot2`, `corrplot`, `foreign`, `lubridate`, `viridis`                    

### If you are running scripts individually: 
3. Run the following scripts (in order) with specified arguments.

  - [load_data.R](https://stat547-ubc-2019-20.github.io/group_12_qiyangqd_xiaoyuanf/scripts/load_data.R): Save the raw data as a .csv in the `data` folder from an external URL.         
  `Rscript scripts/load_data.R     --data_url=https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00381/PRSA_data_2010.1.1-2014.12.31.csv`    
  
  - [data_wrangle.R](https://stat547-ubc-2019-20.github.io/group_12_qiyangqd_xiaoyuanf/scripts/data_wrangle.R): Save a new cleaned dataset as a .csv in the `data` folder.      
  `Rscript scripts/data_wrangle.R --raw_path=<raw_data_path> --clean_path=<clean_data_path>`
  
  - [eda.R](https://stat547-ubc-2019-20.github.io/group_12_qiyangqd_xiaoyuanf/scripts/eda.R): Run exploratory data analysis and save the plots in a user defined location.         
  `Rscript scripts/eda.R --raw_path=<raw_data_path> --clean_path=<clean_data_path> --image_path=<image_path>`

  `Rscript scripts/model.R --clean_path=<clean_data_path> --model_path=<model_path>`
  
  - [knit.R](https://stat547-ubc-2019-20.github.io/group_12_qiyangqd_xiaoyuanf/scripts/knit.R): Knit the final report.              
  `Rscript scripts/knit.R --rmd_path=<rmd_path>`

### If you are using GNU MAKE:

3. Open the Terminal in your RStudio. Type the following options according to your needs:

- Check if `make` has already been installed:   
      `make`
  * If yes: `make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.`    
  * If no: `Command not found`

- If you want to get all targets:    
  `make all`  
  
- If you want to clear all existing targets and recreate them:     
  `make clear`
